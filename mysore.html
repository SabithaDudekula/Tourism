                <p>Mysore Palace, also called the Amba Vilas Palace, is one of the grandest royal residences in India, located in the city of Mysuru, Karnataka.
It was originally built centuries ago, but the current structure was commissioned in 1897 by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV after the old palace was destroyed by fire.
Designed by the British architect Henry Irwin, the palace is a stunning example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, blending Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles.
Built with fine grey granite and adorned with pink marble domes, it has an imposing central arch, beautiful towers, and intricate carvings.
The interiors are breathtaking, with richly decorated halls, stained glass ceilings, ornate wooden doors, and detailed paintings depicting royal life.
The palace houses the royal family’s treasures, artifacts, and ceremonial items, keeping alive the grandeur of the Wadiyar dynasty.
Every year during the Dussehra festival, the palace is illuminated with nearly 100,000 bulbs, creating a magical golden glow that attracts thousands of visitors.
Surrounded by beautiful gardens and courtyards, Mysore Palace is not just an architectural wonder but also a symbol of Karnataka’s rich history and culture.
