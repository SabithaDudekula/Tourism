                <p> Taj Mahal, synonymous with India’s identity, is the crowning jewel of Mughal architecture in India.
                    The Mughal tradition of erecting majestic mausoleums in memory of Royal members found its culmination in the Taj’s majestic form.
                    The Humayun’s tomb built in 1562 was a major influence over Taj’s design.
                    An architectural marvel, the structure incorporates elements of Persian influences like the design of the Dome and incorporation of arched entrances or ‘Iwans’ 
                    along with inspiration from contemporary Hindu design elements like chhatris and copious incorporation of the lotus motif.
                     Described by Tagore as “the tear-drop on the cheek of time”, the monument embodies funereal austerity turned into 
                     the most beautiful reminder of eternal love.
                     Taj Mahal is part of an elaborate complex consisting of a decorative gateway, 
                     a beautifully designed garden, a wonderful water system and a mosque. 
                     The complex is situated on the southern banks of river Yamuna. 
                     The complex stretches in a south to north incline towards the river and is constructed in steps.
