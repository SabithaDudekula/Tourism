                <p>Amaravati, on the peaceful banks of the Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh, is a city where the past and the future meet.
                Over 2,000 years ago, it was a great center of Buddhism, attracting monks and scholars from all over Asia.
                The famous Amaravati Stupa, built during the Satavahana dynasty, was one of the largest in India, covered in white marble carvings showing stories from Buddha’s life.
                Travelers from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and China visited this holy site to study and meditate.
                Today, the majestic Dhyana Buddha statue stands tall, reminding visitors of the city’s spiritual importance.
                Amaravati is also the planned capital of Andhra Pradesh, symbolizing the state’s vision to blend ancient wisdom with modern development.
