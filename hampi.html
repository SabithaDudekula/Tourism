                <p>Hampi, located in Karnataka, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most remarkable historical places in India.
                It was once the magnificent capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th century, one of the richest and most powerful kingdoms of its time.
                Spread across a landscape of giant boulders, lush banana plantations, and the Tungabhadra River, Hampi is filled with stunning temples, palaces, markets, and royal complexes.
                Some of its most famous monuments include the Virupaksha Temple, Vittala Temple with its iconic stone chariot, and the Lotus Mahal.
                Hampi was a major trading center for gems, spices, and horses, attracting merchants from across the world.
                Even today, the ruins showcase the architectural brilliance of the Vijayanagara kings, with intricate carvings and grand designs.
                Every corner of Hampi feels like a step back in time, making it a paradise for history lovers, photographers, and travelers.
                Its beauty lies not just in its monuments, but also in the magical sunrise and sunset views over its rocky hills.
