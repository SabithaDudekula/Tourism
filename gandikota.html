                <p>Endearingly known as the ‘Grand Canyon of India’, Gandikota is a small and quaint village in the Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh.
                    Flanked by River Pennar on the right side, the village is famous for the spectacular gorges formed by the river cutting through Erramala Hills. 
                    The narrow valleys with streams running between them and the steep rocky walls are reminiscent of the renowned Grand Canyon in Arizona.
                    It requires a walk of almost a kilometre from the main gate to reach the boulder from where you can observe the mesmerising view from the viewpoint near the fort.
                    Located 1.5 hours away from Belum Caves, the highlight of the village of Gandikota is the ruins of Gandikota Fort, which was built in the 13th Century.
