                <p>The Charminar, located in the heart of Hyderabad, Telangana, is one of India’s most iconic monuments and a symbol of the city itself.
                    It was built in 1591 by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty.
                    The monument’s name means “Four Minarets,” referring to its four grand towers, each standing about 48 meters high.
                    It is said that the Sultan built the Charminar to commemorate the end of a deadly plague and as the foundation for the new city of Hyderabad.
                    Constructed using granite and lime mortar, it is an excellent example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences.
                    Each minaret has a spiral staircase with 149 steps, leading to breathtaking views of the old city.
                    The Charminar is surrounded by vibrant markets, especially Laad Bazaar, famous for bangles, pearls, and traditional handicrafts.
                    In the evenings, the monument is beautifully illuminated, adding charm to the bustling streets around it.
                    Even after more than four centuries, the Charminar remains a living piece of history and a proud symbol of Hyderabad’s heritage.
